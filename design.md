# DSL Design for Student Program Evaluation Generator 

## Overview

The Student Program Evaluation Generator makes use of a maintained database containing information from course catalogs and program evaluations in order to generate a college student's four-year academic plan. It includes functions for creating and manipulating the database as well as custom type blocks for Course and Plan.

## Custom Types 

### Custom Type: "Course"

#### Semantics
The custom type for Course represents a course or class and its relevant data from within the database. Users can find, add, delete and update course objects within the database using this block. 

#### Usage
```dsl
Course { 
    code = "CPSC350"
    name = "Data Structures"
    credits = 3
    semester = "Fall or Spring"
    difficultyScore = 2.5
}
```

### Custom Type: "Plan"

#### Semantics
The custom type for Plan represents the four-year plan that is generated by the program. 

#### Usage
```dsl
Plan {
    semester1: [Course1, Course2, ...]
    semester2: [Course3, Course4, ...]
    semester3: [Course5, Course6, ...]
    -- Continues for until semester8 for the four-year plan.
}
```

## Functions

### 'FIND' 

#### Semantics
The FIND function retrieves information from the database regarding a course and relevant information. 

#### Usage
```dsl
FIND {
    entity: Course
    criteria: code == "CPSC350"
}
```

### ADD

#### Semantics
The ADD function allows users to add a new course with its relevant data to the database.

#### Usage
```dsl
ADD {
    entity: Course
    data: Course{
        code: "CPSC350",
        name: "Data Structures",
        credits: 3,
        semester: "Fall or Spring"
    }
}
```

### DELETE

#### Semantics
The DELETE function allows users to remove a course, program evaluation, or other relevant data from the database.

#### Usage
```dsl
DELETE { 
    entity: Course
    criteria: code == "CPSC350"
}
```

### UPDATE

#### Semantics
The UPDATE function allows users to update an existing course, program evaluation or other relvant data within the database. 

#### Usage
```dsl
UPDATE {
    entity: Course
    criteria: code == "CPSC350"
    data: Course{
        credits: 3,
        semester: "Fall Only"
    }
}
```

### GENERATE

#### Semantics
The GENERATE function allows users to generate their four-year plan. The function takes into account their major and corresponding course catalog and program evaluation by selecting from a drop down in Blockly. Their data regarding their choices is accessed from the database to generate the four-year plan. 

Each semester is restricted by a minimum 13 credits and maximum of 18 credits. The program averages the difficulty scores of the courses within one semester for the overall difficulty score of that term. The range of the semester's difficulty score should be within 1.5-2.0 and generates semester schedules to reach this average.

#### Usage
```dsl
GENERATE {
    Major: Dropdown {
        options: ["Computer Science", "Data Science", "Data Analytics"]
        variableName: "studentMajor"
    }
    ProgramEvaluation: Dropdown {
        options: ["2019-2020", "2020-2021", "2021-2022"]
        variableName: "studentProgramEvaluation"
    }
    Restrictions: {
        mininmumCreditsPerSemester: 13
        maximumCreditsPerSemester: 18
        avgDifficultyScoreRange: [1.5, 2.0]
    }
    -- Reference to Dropdown that can be created in Blockly.
}
```
