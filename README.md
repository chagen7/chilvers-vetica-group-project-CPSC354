# Motivation

* With college being an experience for young adults that comes with challenging times trying to juggle life and school, creating and managing a four year plan and program evaluation to ensure that one will graduate on time can get confusing. This task is normally time consuming since it requires the student to compare across the major catalog, courses being offered, and keeping track of what they have taken and will take. The Student Program Evaluation Generator will help ease up the stress by being a user-friendly, transparent, and optimized program evaluation, empowering students to navigate their academic journey with confidence and ease.

# Description

* The Student Program Evaluation Generator will make use of a maintained database that contains the information for classes based on course catalogs. It navigates class availability, distinguishing between Spring-Only and Fall-Only offerings, and meticulously validates courses against catalog requisites, eliminating the risk of overlooking essential prerequisites. Another feature to help balance the classes across the four years is a point system created by the advisors. With this, each class will be assigned a number from the scale that factors in time commitment and course complexity to ensure that students are not overworked during a semester. Operating on the Blocky programming language, the system seamlessly integrates essential functions like FIND, ADD, DELETE, and UPDATE, ensuring efficient data manipulation. The result is a personalized program evaluation freeing students from the burden of cross-referencing numerous catalogs and evaluations.
