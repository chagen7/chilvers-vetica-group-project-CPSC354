## Milestone1

### How to run and test

* To run Milestone1, click on the [link to run Milestone1](https://odchilvers.github.io/chilvers-vetica-group-project-CPSC354/milestone1/index.html). Once the github page has opened, chose blocks from customBlocks and build different functions. Use generate code to see what code is ocurring, save code to save the code as a .js file, and currently generate four year plan does not work yet.
* *Please note that there is no database currently so the functions will produce the code that is happening at the moment and not the full features*
* We recommend testing the add course function with different inputs and see what will be going into the database.
